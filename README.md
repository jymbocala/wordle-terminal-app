# Wordle by Jym 

### Installation and Gameplay
1. **Check Python Install Status**: Wordle requires Python 3 or higher to run.

    To check if Python is installed and verify its current version, open a new terminal window and enter the following command:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
    This should return a message with the Python version, such as:
    ```
    Python 3.10.1
    ```
    If Python is not installed or the version is lower than 3.0, please visit the official [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for installation instructions.
