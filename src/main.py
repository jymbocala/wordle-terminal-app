print(f'Great! Hi, {name}! It\'s nice to meet you. Now, let me explain how Wordle works. \nðŸ§© Wordle is a word-guessing game where you\'ll need to guess a secret five-letter word. You have six attempts to guess the word correctly. After each guess, I\'ll provide feedback to help you narrow down the possibilities. Each letter in the word will be color-coded to let you know if it\'s in the word, and if it\'s in the right position. Your goal is to crack the code as quickly as possible! \nTo make a guess, simply type a five-letter word, and I\'ll let you know how you\'re doing. \nAre you ready to start playing and put your word skills to the test? \n')
