You have six attempts to guess the word correctly. After each guess, I\'ll provide feedback to help you narrow down the possibilities. Each letter in the word will be color-coded to let you know if it\'s in the word, and if it\'s in the right position. Your goal is to crack the code as quickly as possible! \nTo make a guess, simply type a five-letter word, and I\'ll let you know how you\'re doing. \nAre you ready to start playing and put your word skills to the test? \n')
